This is the Android SDK for Pusher's push notification service - [Beams](https://pusher.com/beams)

The SDK is written in Kotlin, but aimed to be as Java-friendly as possible

## Installation

### Update your project level gradle config

```
buildscript {
    ...

    dependencies {
        // Add this line
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:3.1.0'
    }
}
```

### Update your app level gradle config

```
dependencies {
    ...

    // Add these lines
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:11.8.0'
